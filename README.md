# Support Vector Machine-Machine learning
## Model Evaluation and Validation
## Project: Digits-Recongnition

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

### Code
Template code is provided in the `digits-recongition(2).ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included Python file and dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.
